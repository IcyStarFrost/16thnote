# 16th Note
A three hour project designed to add combat and ambient music to Garry's Mod gameplay, similar to Nombat. However, Nombat is rather old and the process to creating music with the addon is time consuming and discouraging for most inexperienced with LUA.
This addon aims to be a better alternative.

### What does "16th Note" have over Nombat?
16th Note takes what Nombat does and improves upon it. Such as the following:

* Massively improves user experience when it comes to creating music addons
* Internal code is neater (imo) when compared to Nombat

That's pretty much it.
